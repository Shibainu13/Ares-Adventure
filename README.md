# Ares-Adventure - Sokoban Solver

## Overview
**Ares-Adventure** is a Python-based Sokoban puzzle solver that implements four search algorithms: **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**, and **A\* Search**. The project focuses on exploring the efficiency and performance of these algorithms in solving Sokoban puzzles, where the goal is to move stones onto designated switches in a grid environment.
